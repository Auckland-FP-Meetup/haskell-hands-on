# Setup for FP Hands-on Haskell

## If you are new To Haskell

First do the “5 minute” tutorial at http://www.tryhaskell.org/

Then, we will use the exercises at https://repl.it/@utdemir/fp-auckland-haskell-hands-on

(These are from https://github.com/noelmarkham/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises , and are already setup in repl.it for you. Repl.it is a free online IDE, so it just works in your browser.)

These exercises follow the free online book “Learn You A Haskell for Great Good” ( http://learnyouahaskell.com/ )

Feel free to get started reading the book and doing the exercises before the meetup if you can. Since we are using Repl.it, you can ignore the parts of the book on how to install Haskell, since they are a bit out-of-date anyway.

To load the exercises from a particular file into the REPL, issue a command like “:l 02.hs”.

## If you already know some Haskell
### Tools

You may use whichever text editor you prefer.

One option to consider is Atom with Haskell:

    Atom: https://atom.io/
    Haskell for Atom https://github.com/simonmichael/haskell-atom-setup

### Practical exercises
#### Exercism (next step beyond beginner).  
They will give you some practice using basic skills.  They do not specifically progress your Haskell knowledge, but are good for building confidence with what you already know.

http://exercism.io/languages/haskell/exercises

You need to install `stack` and the exercism tool, instructions are on the exercism website.

#### Data 61 (a bit harder)

Data 61’s FP course: https://github.com/data61/fp-course

These exercises are nicely setup, but not for beginners.

Please follow the setup instructions:

https://github.com/data61/fp-course/blob/master/README.markdown#getting-started

Note that the README, although long, is required reading if following the exercises!

NB: If this is your first time attending a hands-on session, please do the setup a few days before the course, since the downloads can take some time.  Feel free to reach out via the slack channel ( https://fp-akl-meetup.slack.com/ ) for help with exercises or setup.
